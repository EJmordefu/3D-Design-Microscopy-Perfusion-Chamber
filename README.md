# Custom Perfusion Chamber for Inverted and Upright Microscopy

## Overview
This repository contains the design files (STL) for a custom perfusion chamber optimized for live-cell imaging under controlled environmental conditions. The chamber is designed to accommodate an 18 mm coverslip within a central, elliptically shaped fluidic compartment, allowing for laminar flow and minimizing medium volume. It is compatible with both **inverted and upright microscopy**, providing versatility for various imaging setups.

## Features
- **Microscopy Compatibility**: The chamber includes an opening suitable for both **inverted and upright microscopy**, ensuring precise sample positioning and flexibility in experimental setups.
- **Dual Coverslip Design**: A second coverslip placed above the sample separates the perfusion medium from the objective immersion medium, reducing refractive index mismatches.
- **Bubble Trap & Stimuli Introduction**: A pre-chamber opening facilitates the introduction of stimuli and acts as a bubble trap.
- **Magnetic Assembly**: The components are held together using circular magnets (5 mm diameter, 1 mm thickness), ensuring a secure fit while allowing easy assembly and disassembly.
- **Optimized Fluid Dynamics**: The internal fluidic path ensures uniform perfusion with low flow rates to maintain cell viability during experiments.

## Components
The chamber consists of five main parts:
1. **Base**: Holds the 18 mm coverslip and provides the foundation for the fluidic compartment.
2. **Top Cover**: Creates the perfusion space above the coverslip, integrating internal fluidic inlets, outlets, and the bubble trap.
3. **Magnetic Holders (2 pieces)**: Semi-circular components that secure the top cover onto the base using magnetic force. They apply uniform pressure to prevent fluid leakage.
4. **Tubing Holder**: A belt-like piece that stabilizes the tubing, preventing unwanted movement.

## Fabrication
- The chamber was fabricated using a **Voxelab Proxima 6.0 SLA 3D printer**.
- Designed to work with **PVC tubing (ID 1/16”, OD 1/8”, wall thickness 1/32”)**.
- The magnetic assembly ensures a tight seal, further reinforced with high-vacuum grease to prevent leaks.

## Imaging Setup
- The chamber was tested using:
  - A **Leica TCS-SP8 upright confocal microscope** with a **40X water immersion objective**.
  - A **Leica Thunder inverted microscope**, with objectives up to **63X**.
